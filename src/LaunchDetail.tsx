      Falcon 9 is a reusable, two-stage rocket designed and manufactured by SpaceX for the reliable
      and safe transport of people and payloads into Earth orbit and beyond. Falcon 9 is the worldâ€™s
      first orbital class reusable rocket. Reusability allows SpaceX to refly the most expensive
      parts of the rocket, which in turn drives down the cost of space access.
